**Project Description/Information:**

Contained in this folder is a Juypter Notebook structured as a tutorial, detailing how to train and use a yield prediction model for farms, intended for use by smaller farms in place of more costly precision agriculture services. The tutorial is structured around the general phases of a data science workflow for organizational purposes.

All work (aside from raw data collection) for the creation of the tutorial was completed exclusively by myself. Data used was from a study completed by the University of Nebraska that yielded publicly available datasets, linked to in the project itself but not included in this repository due to the size of the raw data.
