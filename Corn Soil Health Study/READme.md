Contained in this folder is a PDF print-out of a Juypter Notebook running through a pseudo-tutorial of how an investigation into the relationship between corn yields and the crop's growing conditions was carried out. All work for both the investigation and writing of the tutorial was completed exclusively by myself. Data used was from a study completed by the University of Iowa that yielded the included public datasets.
