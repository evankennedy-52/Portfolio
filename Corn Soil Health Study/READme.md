Project Description/Information:

Contained in this folder is a PDF print-out of a Juypter Notebook running through a pseudo-tutorial of how an investigation into the relationship between corn yields and the crop's growing conditions was carried out. The investigation was carried out intentionally following the standard data science pipeline, with clearly marked steps for the sake of the tutorial design.

All work (aside from raw data collection) for both the investigation and the tutorial was completed exclusively by myself. Data used was from a study completed by the University of Iowa that yielded the included publicly available datasets.
