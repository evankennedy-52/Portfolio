# Portfolio
Hi, I'm Evan Kennedy, and this is my portfolio!

The repository you are currently viewing is a collection of projects I have completed for various reasons. Not all work I complete is published here for various reasons of privacy and allowable disclosure, however, the projects included are nonetheless a meaningful reflection of the sort of work I value. For any interested, I hope it is a useful slice of my experiences to gauge a proxy of my skillset.

Enjoy and view freely, and the all the best to you  
Evan Kennedy
