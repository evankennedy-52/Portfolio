**Project Description/Information**

Contained in this folder is the final product, a formal poster created and used for presentation, of an investigation into weather forecast accuracy. The investigation compared accuracy performance between small-scale local forecasters and larger-scale forecasting operations. Data analysis for this project was carried out primarily through the statistical tests detailed in the poster, with data manipulated in Excel using custom written scripts.

All work of data collection, analysis, and presentation for this project was completed exclusively by myself.
